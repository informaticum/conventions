# Informaticum :: Code Conventions/Developer Settings

Hi there,

if you want to support the informaticum projects, you should be aware of our code styles, conventions and formatter rules.

In order to ...

* keep the code consistent, 
* prevent encoding problems, 
* understand new code more quickly and thoroughly,
* avoid arguing over syntax, naming standards, and style preferences

... [we must insist on consistent code](https://www.google.de/search?q=coding+style+matters).

Avowedly, good code style is a subjective matter and the perception of beauty is in the eye of the beholder.
However, these are the rules which we think are fine for us:
